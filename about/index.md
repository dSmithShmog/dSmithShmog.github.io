## Here We Go
All jokes aside this is really hard. I find stuffing myself into a few paragraphs difficult. I'm not sure if that's a weakness of my writing abilities
or just a result of being a complicated person. It's hard to write about the majority of myself in a concise and compelling way. When asked for advice and descriptors people tell me I'm blunt, persistent, honest, dedicated, and assertive. One even went so far as to call me relentless. But they also think I'm deep, loyal, passionate, and complex. I bask in the weird and sometimes unreconcilable facets of myself.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science, but I identify more as a dancer even though I only have two years of experience. I'm a massive nerd, but I spend inordinate amounts of time and energy
on being healthy and fit. Many people, when first meeting me, find me to be either cold and intimidating or boisterous and entertaining to the point of being obnoxious. But, those closest to me describe me as secretly soft, caring, and deeply emotional. One person who used to be quite close to me described me as being like a dam. That is, unreadable on the surface, but once the flood gates open . . . Well the rest is obvious. 

I guess you could say I am a person of contradiction. I enjoy learning and experience all sorts of different things. Because of that my passion lies in finding, appreciating, and then articulating connections between things that others (and myself) may at first assume are entirely alien to one another. For example, sometimes when learning new dance choreography and technique I often approach it very systematically; that is, like a software engineer. I watch an example. I don't mean watch like one watches a movie. I mean I WATCH it. I see it, in the deepest sense. I see muscles moving, body positioning, points of rotation and balance, and so much more. Then I ask myself how I can convince my body to do the same thing one piece at a time. Connections like these are everywhere. They hide in what we do, what we see, and more importantly how we see. For me at least, they are a large part of the reason life is beautiful.
