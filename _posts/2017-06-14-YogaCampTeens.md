## Scene

It's the middle of Tuesday at iD Tech Princeton. This is a tech camp I worked at for two summers. The staff is comprised of around 20 instructors who teach everything from Java & Python to how to design levels in minecraft or build robots. Students that stay overnight and essentially live at camp arrive sunday night and day-campers arrive monday morning. From there each instructor has up to 8 kids who they teach for the rest of the week. Something you should know is that at camp all the instructors go by camp names **exclusively**. So for 8 weeks you are your camp self. You can be whoever and however you want as long as you're creating a good environment for the kids and your coworkers. If it's any indication of my presence in camp, whenever I was introduced at intros the entire rest of the staff would chant "He is fire. He is death". Yes, this is from *The Hobbit*. Think aggresive gregorian chanting. Monotone. Creepy. Aggressive. The works. Add that to the fact that I'm above average height/build, I'm loud, and I'm assertive (at camp anyways). Needless to say I was found to be intimidating by many campers in a sort of big brother could-totally-crush-me sort of way. It's tuesday (day two), and the campers are just beginning to get comfortable with me. I get my class up from lunch, and instead of heading back to the labs for more coding or gaming I tell em it's time for yoga and drag them off to the Princeton gardens.

## The Experience

As one might expect my 13-17 year old students often objected to this idea. "What does yoga have to do with programming?", "But it's hot out", and "That sounds stupid" were all common. But, often times they were just as curious as they were rebellious and stubborn. Almost every teenager knows about yoga. But all they really think of are women in LuLu Lemon clothing or ancient monks from the far east. Almost none of them have ever actually **done it**. So I showed them some. I'm no expert and in truth don't **really** know yoga. But I know enough to wow a 13 year old. So we'd get warm and stretch out in the sun in a beautiful garden and get some fresh air. By the end of it we're all loose and relaxed. But most importantly we're focused and happier. They didn't always notice at first, but tuesdays are when my students really started getting the hang for programming and that was no coincidence. I continued this practice on Wednesday and Thursday. By the end, many of my students had learned a healthy appreciation or at least curiousity for Yoga and all the things attached to it.

## From Teacher to Student

A lot of my students at least enjoyed the experience. But a rare few loved it, and an even rarer-fewer went so far as to turn me into the student. At the end of each week all the students and parents review their instructors. One of my students, we'll call them Jack, had something to say. They wanted to thank me for getting them to do yoga and encouraging them to be more social and confident. This shell shocked me. Anyone that teaches knows there are moments that make you want to stay in it. Moments that define the experience of teaching for you. This is one of mine. In the camp environment I had ignored how nerve wracking and embarrassing it can be to do something you're unfamiliar with in front of your peers. Jack reminded me how scary that is and showed me just how far reaching even the simplist thing can be. I only wanted to get my kids outside and give em a taste of fitness, relaxation, and centering. What I got was knocked off my teaching pedestal. Jack showed me that I inadvertantly created a space for them to improve an extremely important and complex part of themselves. The part that wants to try new things, experiment, and be social. What was a lesson in health and exploration, became a way for my students to branch out and grow in ways I couldn't have predicted.
